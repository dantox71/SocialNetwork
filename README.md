## General info

The main goal of this project was to improve my skills in MERN stack. This is my first application where I used React.js & Redux so the code leaves much to be desired.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS33
- React(hooks)
- Redux
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

And many other third party libraries like <strong>jsonwebtoken</strong> or <strong>bcryptjs</strong>

## Features

List of implemented features:

- authentication & authorization with jsonwebtoken
- create/edit/delete profile
- add/edit/remove posts & comments
- like/dislike posts
- alerts

To-do list:

- Implement chat
- Rewrite UI that now doesn't look good :)
